## API-WEATHER

This is my first API and it's a simple weather app, you just type a city or region in the box and get back the temperature, a simply description and a little image.

Before the start you need to go to openweathermap.com and get your apiKey, then create an environment file (.env) with two variables (PORT, KEY), your file need to be something like that:

##### PORT = ... 
##### KEY = ...

clone this repo and just type in the terminal:

### `npm i`

for start just type:
### `nodemon app.js`
